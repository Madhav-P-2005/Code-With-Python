“Why do we fall, Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.”, Thomas Wayne

=> For me, this is the best quote and probably the best moral to a movie. Although he’s the hero, batman fails many times
and often choose the wrong way. The thing is, only by failing does he learn how to overcome his failure — only by
falling does he learn how to pick himself up. I think this is the best mantra a movie has ever given to me. We all fall,
that’s natural. But what makes a person successful is his/her ability to fall, understand the situation and figure out
the way to stand up, and go on, stronger and smarter than before. Whenever I feel frustrated from my failures (and
there’s a bunch), I try to remember this quote and act according to it.
