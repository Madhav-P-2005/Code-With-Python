# Problems in Procedure Oriented Approach :-

'''

1) Procedural programming mainly focuses on procedures or functions. Less attention is
given to the data.

2) The data and functions are separate from each other.

3) Global data is freely moving and is shared among various functions. Thus, it becomes
difficult for programmers to identify and fix issues in a program that originate due to
incorrect data handling.

4) Changes in data types need to be carried out manually all over the program and in the
functions using the same data type.

5) Limited and difficult code reusability.

6) It does not model real-world entities (e.g., car, table, bank account, loan) very well where
we as a human being, perceive everything as an object.

7) The procedural programming approach does not work well for large and complex
systems.
