# An array is an object that stores a group of elements (or values) of same data type. The main advantage of array is to store and process a group of elements easily.

# Key Points :- 1) Arrays can store only one type of data.
#               2) Arrays can increase or decrease their size dynamically.


# Advantages of Arrays :- 
''' 1) Arrays are similar to lists. The main difference is that arrays can store only one type
of elements; whereas, lists can store different types of elements. When dealing with a
huge number of elements, arrays use less memory than lists and they offer faster
execution than lists.'''

''' 2) The size of the array is not fixed in Python. Hence, we need not specify how many
elements we are going to store into an array in the beginning.'''


''' 3) Arrays can grow or shrink in memory dynamically (during runtime).'''


''' 4) Arrays are useful to handle a collection of elements like a group of numbers or
characters.'''

''' 5) Methods that are useful to process the elements of any array are available in 'array'

# Creating an Array :- Arrays can hold data of same type. The type should be specified by using a type code at the time of creating the array object as: - 

# Syntax :- arrayname = array(type code, [elements])

# Example :- a = array('i', [4, 6, 2, 9])

'''
The type code 'i', represents integer type array where we can store integer numbers. If
the type code is 'f' then it represents float type array where we can store numbers with
decimal point.
